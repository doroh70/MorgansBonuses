Displaying employee bonus after longevity and review data is entered by the user

Morganâ€™s Department Store distributes bonuses to its salespeople after the holiday rush. Table 9-6 shows the bonuses, which are based on full weeks worked during the season and the number of positive online customer reviews. Write a program that allows a user to continuously enter values for the two bonus-determining factors and displays the appropriate bonus. Save the file as MorgansBonuses.java.
